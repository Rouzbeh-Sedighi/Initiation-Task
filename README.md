Software Team: Initiation Task
Every new member gets a task on joining one of the Space Concordia divisions. In Robotics we
have different squads; therefore the tasks are different. The software team deals with the
software system in the bigger picture: From programming the operator GUI (Graphic User
Interface) to using LiDAR to map out the rover’s surrounding environment, we concern
ourselves with all aspects of the code running both on the client’s base station and on the rover
server, including applying ROS (Robot Operating System) as ‘glue code’ between the different
squads’ code. This task will demonstrate the some of the fundamental ideas that are behind our
system to you as well as your ability to work independently to us.
Task: Given an arduino and any sensor/ actuator of your choice, either:

● Program the arduino to report sensor values. Then capture those sensor values over
serial connection (USB) and display them in a GUI on the base station using flask (a
python web-framework).

● Program the arduino to wait for incoming signal from a serial connection (USB). Then
program a GUI using flask to control one or more aspects of the actuator (e.g. controlling
the rate at which LED blinks).
You must create a repository on github to version control your code.
Description: This task is designed to give you an introductory feel of both back and front-end
aspects of programming for robotics, as well as practice using git.
First step, if you haven’t already, is to configure your setup: install python, and the arduino IDE.
Next you’ll need an arduino. There are some nanos in the space lab that you can use but you
can’t take them home (you have to be a member to be allowed to take it home).
There is also the technology sandbox in Webster Library, LB-211.00 which tends to be open
weekdays from 10am - 6pm and has arduino/raspberry pi kits that you can also use. If you can’t
get an arduino right away, you can still get started by working on the flask GUI.
Go look online for the documentation, video tutorials, whatever resources you find the most
helpful to completing this task.
Time: One week.
Steps that may help:

1. Research concepts: Git, Arduino, Python, Flask, HTML/JS/CSS, Arduino Serial library,
Python pyserial library

2. Try to get it to work first without an actual sensor, to focus on getting the serial
communication going properly

3. Ask questions!
Extra things:

1. If you are done and still have time (and the will), start looking into ROS and see if you
can ‘rosify’ your code in any way.
